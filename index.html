	<h4>	“If you think you are beaten, you are,
			If you think you dare not, you don’t
			If you like to win, but you think you can’t,
			It is almost certain you won’t.
			“If you think you’ll lose, you’re lost
			For out of the world we find,
			Success begins with a fellow’s will-
			It’s all in the state of mind.
			“If you think you are outclassed, you are,
			You’ve got to think high to rise,
			You’ve got to be sure of yourself before
			You can ever win a prize.
			“Life’s battles don’t always go
			To the stronger or faster man,
			But soon or late the man who wins
			Is the man WHO THINKS HE CAN!”
